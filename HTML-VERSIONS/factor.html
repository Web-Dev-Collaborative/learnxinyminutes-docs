<p>Factor is a modern stack-based language, based on Forth, created by Slava Pestov.</p>
<p>Code in this file can be typed into Factor, but not directly imported because the vocabulary and import header would make the beginning thoroughly confusing.</p>
<pre class="factor"><code>! This is a comment

! Like Forth, all programming is done by manipulating the stack.
! Stating a literal value pushes it onto the stack.
5 2 3 56 76 23 65    ! No output, but stack is printed out in interactive mode

! Those numbers get added to the stack, from left to right.
! .s prints out the stack non-destructively.
.s     ! 5 2 3 56 76 23 65

! Arithmetic works by manipulating data on the stack.
5 4 +    ! No output

! `.` pops the top result from the stack and prints it.
.    ! 9

! More examples of arithmetic:
6 7 * .        ! 42
1360 23 - .    ! 1337
12 12 / .      ! 1
13 2 mod .     ! 1

99 neg .       ! -99
-99 abs .      ! 99
52 23 max .    ! 52
52 23 min .    ! 23

! A number of words are provided to manipulate the stack, collectively known as shuffle words.

3 dup -          ! duplicate the top item (1st now equals 2nd): 3 - 3
2 5 swap /       ! swap the top with the second element:        5 / 2
4 0 drop 2 /     ! remove the top item (don&#39;t print to screen):  4 / 2
1 2 3 nip .s     ! remove the second item (similar to drop):    1 3
1 2 clear .s     ! wipe out the entire stack
1 2 3 4 over .s  ! duplicate the second item to the top: 1 2 3 4 3
1 2 3 4 2 pick .s ! duplicate the third item to the top: 1 2 3 4 2 3

! Creating Words
! The `:` word sets Factor into compile mode until it sees the `;` word.
: square ( n -- n ) dup * ;    ! No output
5 square .                     ! 25

! We can view what a word does too.
! \ suppresses evaluation of a word and pushes its identifier on the stack instead.
\ square see    ! : square ( n -- n ) dup * ;

! After the name of the word to create, the declaration between brackets gives the stack effect.
! We can use whatever names we like inside the declaration:
: weirdsquare ( camel -- llama ) dup * ;

! Provided their count matches the word&#39;s stack effect:
: doubledup ( a -- b ) dup dup ; ! Error: Stack effect declaration is wrong
: doubledup ( a -- a a a ) dup dup ; ! Ok
: weirddoubledup ( i -- am a fish ) dup dup ; ! Also Ok

! Where Factor differs from Forth is in the use of quotations.
! A quotation is a block of code that is pushed on the stack as a value.
! [ starts quotation mode; ] ends it.
[ 2 + ]       ! Quotation that adds 2 is left on the stack
4 swap call . ! 6

! And thus, higher order words. TONS of higher order words.
2 3 [ 2 + ] dip .s      ! Pop top stack value, run quotation, push it back: 4 3
3 4 [ + ] keep .s       ! Copy top stack value, run quotation, push the copy: 7 4
1 [ 2 + ] [ 3 + ] bi .s ! Run each quotation on the top value, push both results: 3 4
4 3 1 [ + ] [ + ] bi .s ! Quotations in a bi can pull values from deeper on the stack: 4 5 ( 1+3 1+4 )
1 2 [ 2 + ] bi@ .s      ! Run the quotation on first and second values
2 [ + ] curry           ! Inject the given value at the start of the quotation: [ 2 + ] is left on the stack

! Conditionals
! Any value is true except the built-in value f.
! A built-in value t does exist, but its use isn&#39;t essential.
! Conditionals are higher order words as with the combinators above.

5 [ &quot;Five is true&quot; . ] when                     ! Five is true
0 [ &quot;Zero is true&quot; . ] when                     ! Zero is true
f [ &quot;F is true&quot; . ] when                        ! No output
f [ &quot;F is false&quot; . ] unless                     ! F is false
2 [ &quot;Two is true&quot; . ] [ &quot;Two is false&quot; . ] if   ! Two is true

! By default the conditionals consume the value under test, but starred variants
! leave it alone if it&#39;s true:

5 [ . ] when*      ! 5
f [ . ] when*      ! No output, empty stack, f is consumed because it&#39;s false


! Loops
! You&#39;ve guessed it.. these are higher order words too.

5 [ . ] each-integer               ! 0 1 2 3 4
4 3 2 1 0 5 [ + . ] each-integer   ! 0 2 4 6 8
5 [ &quot;Hello&quot; . ] times              ! Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello

! Here&#39;s a list:
{ 2 4 6 8 }                        ! Goes on the stack as one item

! Loop through the list:
{ 2 4 6 8 } [ 1 + . ] each          ! Prints 3 5 7 9
{ 2 4 6 8 } [ 1 + ] map             ! Leaves { 3 5 7 9 } on stack

! Loop reducing or building lists:
{ 1 2 3 4 5 } [ 2 mod 0 = ] filter  ! Keeps only list members for which quotation yields true: { 2 4 }  
{ 2 4 6 8 } 0 [ + ] reduce .        ! Like &quot;fold&quot; in functional languages: prints 20 (0+2+4+6+8)
{ 2 4 6 8 } 0 [ + ] accumulate . .  ! Like reduce but keeps the intermediate values in a list: prints { 0 2 6 12 } then 20
1 5 [ 2 * dup ] replicate .         ! Loops the quotation 5 times and collects the results in a list: { 2 4 8 16 32 }
1 [ dup 100 &lt; ] [ 2 * dup ] produce ! Loops the second quotation until the first returns false and collects the results: { 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 }

! If all else fails, a general purpose while loop:
1 [ dup 10 &lt; ] [ &quot;Hello&quot; . 1 + ] while  ! Prints &quot;Hello&quot; 10 times
                                        ! Yes, it&#39;s hard to read
                                        ! That&#39;s what all those variant loops are for

! Variables
! Usually Factor programs are expected to keep all data on the stack.
! Using named variables makes refactoring harder (and it&#39;s called Factor for a reason)
! Global variables, if you must:

SYMBOL: name            ! Creates name as an identifying word
&quot;Bob&quot; name set-global   ! No output
name get-global .       ! &quot;Bob&quot;                     

! Named local variables are considered an extension but are available
! In a quotation..
[| m n                  ! Quotation captures top two stack values into m and n
 | m n + ]              ! Read them

! Or in a word..
:: lword ( -- )           ! Note double colon to invoke lexical variable extension
   2 :&gt; c                 ! Declares immutable variable c to hold 2
   c . ;                  ! Print it out

! In a word declared this way,  the input side of the stack declaration
! becomes meaningful and gives the variable names stack values are captured into
:: double ( a -- result ) a 2 * ;

! Variables are declared mutable by ending their name with a shriek
:: mword2 ( a! -- x y )   ! Capture top of stack in mutable variable a
   a                      ! Push a
   a 2 * a!               ! Multiply a by 2 and store result back in a
   a ;                    ! Push new value of a
5 mword2                  ! Stack: 5 10

! Lists and Sequences
! We saw above how to push a list onto the stack

0 { 1 2 3 4 } nth         ! Access a particular member of a list: 1
10 { 1 2 3 4 } nth        ! Error: sequence index out of bounds
1 { 1 2 3 4 } ?nth        ! Same as nth if index is in bounds: 2
10 { 1 2 3 4 } ?nth       ! No error if out of bounds: f

{ &quot;at&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;beginning&quot; } &quot;Append&quot; prefix    ! { &quot;Append&quot; &quot;at&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;beginning&quot; }
{ &quot;Append&quot; &quot;at&quot; &quot;the&quot; } &quot;end&quot; suffix          ! { &quot;Append&quot; &quot;at&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;end&quot; }
&quot;in&quot; 1 { &quot;Insert&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;middle&quot; } insert-nth ! { &quot;Insert&quot; &quot;in&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;middle&quot; }
&quot;Concat&quot; &quot;enate&quot; append                       ! &quot;Concatenate&quot; - strings are sequences too
&quot;Concatenate&quot; &quot;Reverse &quot; prepend              ! &quot;Reverse Concatenate&quot;
{ &quot;Concatenate &quot; &quot;seq &quot; &quot;of &quot; &quot;seqs&quot; } concat ! &quot;Concatenate seq of seqs&quot;
{ &quot;Connect&quot; &quot;subseqs&quot; &quot;with&quot; &quot;separators&quot; } &quot; &quot; join  ! &quot;Connect subseqs with separators&quot;

! And if you want to get meta, quotations are sequences and can be dismantled..
0 [ 2 + ] nth                              ! 2
1 [ 2 + ] nth                              ! +
[ 2 + ] \ - suffix                         ! Quotation [ 2 + - ]
