<p>Nim (formerly Nimrod) is a statically typed, imperative programming language that gives the programmer power without compromises on runtime efficiency.</p>
<p>Nim is efficient, expressive, and elegant.</p>
<pre class="nim"><code># Single-line comments start with a #

#[
  This is a multiline comment.
  In Nim, multiline comments can be nested, beginning with #[
  ... and ending with ]#
]#

discard &quot;&quot;&quot;
This can also work as a multiline comment.
Or for unparsable, broken code
&quot;&quot;&quot;

var                     # Declare (and assign) variables,

# Data Structures
#

# Tuples

var
  child: tuple[name: string, age: int]   # Tuples have *both* field names
  today: tuple[sun: string, temp: float] # *and* order.

child = (name: &quot;Rudiger&quot;, age: 2) # Assign all at once with literal ()
today.sun = &quot;Overcast&quot;            # or individual fields.
today.temp = 70.1

# Sequences

var
  drinks: seq[string]

drinks = @[&quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Juice&quot;, &quot;Chocolate&quot;] # @[V1,..,Vn] is the sequence literal

drinks.add(&quot;Milk&quot;)

if &quot;Milk&quot; in drinks:
  echo &quot;We have Milk and &quot;, drinks.len - 1, &quot; other drinks&quot;

let myDrink = drinks[2]

#
# Defining Types
#

# Defining your own types puts the compiler to work for you. It&#39;s what makes
# static typing powerful and useful.

type
  Name = string # A type alias gives you a new type that is interchangeable
  Age = int     # with the old type but is more descriptive.
  Person = tuple[name: Name, age: Age] # Define data structures too.
  AnotherSyntax = tuple
    fieldOne: string
    secondField: int

var
  john: Person = (name: &quot;John B.&quot;, age: 17)
  newage: int = 18 # It would be better to use Age than int

john.age = newage # But still works because int and Age are synonyms

type
  Cash = distinct int    # `distinct` makes a new type incompatible with its
  Desc = distinct string # base type.

var
  money: Cash = 100.Cash # `.Cash` converts the int to our type
  description: Desc  = &quot;Interesting&quot;.Desc

when compileBadCode:
  john.age  = money        # Error! age is of type int and money is Cash
  john.name = description  # Compiler says: &quot;No way!&quot;

#
# More Types and Data Structures
#

# Enumerations allow a type to have one of a limited number of values

type
  Color = enum cRed, cBlue, cGreen
  Direction = enum # Alternative formatting
    dNorth
    dWest
    dEast
    dSouth
var
  orient = dNorth # `orient` is of type Direction, with the value `dNorth`
  pixel = cGreen # `pixel` is of type Color, with the value `cGreen`

discard dNorth &gt; dEast # Enums are usually an &quot;ordinal&quot; type

# Subranges specify a limited valid range

type
  DieFaces = range[1..20] # Only an int from 1 to 20 is a valid value
var
  my_roll: DieFaces = 13

when compileBadCode:
  my_roll = 23 # Error!

# Arrays

type
  RollCounter = array[DieFaces, int]  # Array&#39;s are fixed length and
  DirNames = array[Direction, string] # indexed by any ordinal type.
  Truths = array[42..44, bool]
var
  counter: RollCounter
  directions: DirNames
  possible: Truths

possible = [false, false, false] # Literal arrays are created with [V1,..,Vn]
possible[42] = true

directions[dNorth] = &quot;Ahh. The Great White North!&quot;
directions[dWest] = &quot;No, don&#39;t go there.&quot;

my_roll = 13
counter[my_roll] += 1
counter[my_roll] += 1

var anotherArray = [&quot;Default index&quot;, &quot;starts at&quot;, &quot;0&quot;]

of aYes:
  addSugar(3)
of aNo:
  echo &quot;Oh do take a little!&quot;
  addSugar()
# No need for an `else` here. Only `yes` and `no` are possible.

#
# FFI
#

# Because Nim compiles to C, FFI is easy:

proc strcmp(a, b: cstring): cint {.importc: &quot;strcmp&quot;, nodecl.}

let cmp = strcmp(&quot;C?&quot;, &quot;Easy!&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, Nim separates itself from its peers with metaprogramming, performance, and compile-time features.</p>
