<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>SmallBASIC is a fast and easy to learn BASIC language interpreter ideal for everyday calculations, scripts and prototypes. SmallBASIC includes trigonometric, matrices and algebra functions, a built in IDE, a powerful string library, system, sound, and graphic commands along with structured programming syntax.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>SmallBASIC was originally developed by Nicholas Christopoulos in late 1999 for the Palm Pilot. Project development has been continued by Chris Warren-Smith since around 2005.</p>
<p>Versions of SmallBASIC have been made for a number of early hand held devices including Franklin eBookman and the Nokia 770. Also various desktop versions have been released based on a variety of GUI tool-kits, some of which have become defunct. The current supported platforms are Linux and Windows based on SDL2 and Android based on NDK. A desktop command line version is also available, although not typically released in binary form.</p>
<p>In around 2008 a large corporation released a BASIC like programming environment with a similar sounding name. SmallBASIC is not related to this other project.</p>

REM print text
print &quot;hello&quot;
? &quot;? is short for PRINT&quot;

REM Control structures
FOR index = 0 TO 10 STEP 2
  ? &quot;This is line number &quot;; index
NEXT
J=0
REPEAT
 J++
UNTIL J=10
WHILE J&gt;0
 J--
WEND

REM Select case statement
Select Case &quot;Cool&quot;
 Case &quot;null&quot;, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,&quot;Cool&quot;,&quot;blah&quot;
 Case &quot;Not cool&quot;
   PRINT &quot;Epic fail&quot;
 Case Else
   PRINT &quot;Fail&quot;
End Select

REM catching errors with TRY/CATCH
Try
  fn = Freefile
  Open filename For Input As #fn
Catch err
  Print &quot;failed to open&quot;
End Try

REM User defined subs and functions
func add2(x,y)
  &#39; variables may be declared as local within the scope of a SUB or FUNC
  local K
  k = &quot;k will cease to exist when this FUNC returns&quot;
  add2=x+y
end
Print add2(5,5)
sub print_it(it)
  print it
end
print_it &quot;IT....&quot;

REM Display lines and pixels

Color 1: ? &quot;sin(x)&quot;:
Color 8: ? &quot;cos(x)&quot;:
Color 12: ? &quot;tan(x)&quot;

REM SmallBASIC is great for experimenting with fractals and other interesting effects
Delay 3000
Randomize
ff = 440.03
For j = 0 to 20
  r = rnd * 1000 % 255
  b = rnd * 1000 % 255
  g = rnd * 1000 % 255
  c = rgb(r,b,g)
  ff += 9.444
  for i=0 to 25000
    f += ff
    x = min(xmax, -x + cos(f*i))
    y = min(ymax, -y + sin(f*i))
    pset x, y color c
    if (i%1000==0) then
      showpage

REM For computer historians, SmallBASIC can run programs
REM found in early computer books and magazines, for example:
10 LET A=9
20 LET B=7
30 PRINT A*B
40 PRINT A/B

REM SmallBASIC also has support for a few modern concepts such as JSON
aa = array(&quot;{\&quot;cat\&quot;:{\&quot;name\&quot;:\&quot;harry\&quot;},\&quot;pet\&quot;:\&quot;true\&quot;}&quot;)
If (ismap(aa) == false) Then
  throw &quot;not an map&quot;
End If
Print aa
